## 🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have Python installed. You will also need to install the `PyQt5` library. You can install it using pip:
```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

### Installation & Running
Clone the project from GitHub to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ErfanKhastar/Password-Generator-With-PyQt5.git
cd Password-Generator-With-PyQt5
```
Enter a number in the input field for the desired password length and click "Generate"!

## 🤔 How It Works

The application generates a password by creating a pool of characters containing `a-z`, `A-Z`, `0-9`, and special symbols (`!`, `@`, `#`, etc.). It then randomly samples unique characters from this pool to construct a password of the specified length.
